## 📅 **Day 1** – The Foundation & Setup *(2 Oct 2025)*

### 🎯 **Focus of the Day** 
Building the right environment for consistent coding

---

### ✅ **Tasks Completed**

- `Initialized Git Repository`: Successfully created a dedicated GitHub repository to track daily progress and code commits.
- `Structured Roadmap`: Organized a comprehensive list of all DSA topics and curated a problem set for each.
- `Created Progress Log`: Set up a clean markdown file (README.md or progress.log) to document descriptions of solved problems and daily learnings.

## 📅 **Day 2** – Binary Search *(3 Oct 2025)*

### 🎯 **Focus of the Day**
Mastering the "Divide and Conquer" strategy by implementing the Binary Search algorithm

---
### ✅ **Tasks Completed**

- Solved: LeetCode 704 - `Binary Search`
  - `Problem`: Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, find the index of the target. If the target does not exist, return -1.
  - `Approach`: Implemented an iterative solution using start, end, and mid pointers to continuously narrow down the search space by half.
  - Complexity Analysis:
    - `Time`: O(log n) — The search area is halved with each iteration.
    - `Space`: O(1) — No extra space is used besides the pointers.
  - `Edge Cases Handled`: Empty array, target not present, target at the beginning or end of the array.

### 💭 **Comment**

- Day 2 done! Nailed Binary Search. The 'divide and conquer' strategy makes sense. On to the next one! 💪
