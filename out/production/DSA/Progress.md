## 📅 **Day 2** – Binary Search *(3 Oct 2025)*

### 🎯 **Focus of the Day**
Applying the "Divide and Conquer" strategy and understanding its time complexity implications.

---

### ✅ **Tasks Completed**

#### 🔹 **Problem 1**: LeetCode 704 - `Binary Search`

- **`Problem`**: Given a sorted array of integers and a target value, find the index of the target. If the target does not exist, return -1.

- **`Approach`**: Implemented an iterative solution using start, end, and mid pointers to continuously narrow down the search space by half.

- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - **`Time`**: O(log n) — The search area is halved with each iteration.
  - **`Space`**: O(1) — No extra space is used besides the pointers.

- **`Edge Cases Handled`**: Empty array, target not present, target at the beginning or end of the array.

---

#### 🔹 **Problem 2**: LeetCode 1 - `Two Sum` (using Binary Search)

- **`Problem`**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

- **`Approach`**: First sorted the array and then used binary search to find the complement for each element.

- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - **`Time`**: O(n log n) — Sorting takes O(n log n) and each binary search takes O(log n).
  - **`Space`**: O(1) — Sorting is done in place.

- **`Edge Cases Handled`**: No solution exists, multiple pairs exist.

---

### 💭 **Reflection**

- Today was a great deep dive into Binary Search. The core logic of halving the search space is elegant and the O(log n) time complexity is a massive improvement <br>over a linear scan. The key insight from "Search Insert Position" was realizing how the loop termination condition and the final state of the pointers can solve variations <br>of the problem.

- A crucial learning moment was recognizing that while Binary Search can be used for the "Two Sum" problem after sorting, a HashMap approach is far more efficient <br>(O(n) time). This highlights that knowing multiple data structures is key to finding the optimal solution. Solid progress! 💪

### ✅ **Tasks Completed**
#### 🔹 **Problem 1**: LeetCode 26 - `Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array`
- **`Problem`**: Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.
- **`Approach`**: Used two pointers - one to iterate through the array and another to track the position of unique elements.
- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - **`Time`**: O(n) — Each element is processed once.
  - **`Space`**: O(1) — No extra space is used.
- **`Edge Cases Handled`**: Empty array, all elements are the same.
---
#### 🔹 **Problem 2**: LeetCode 27 - `Remove Element`

- **`Approach`**: Similar two-pointer technique, where one pointer iterates and the other tracks the position of non-target elements.
- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - **`Time`**: O(n) — Each element is processed once.
  - **`Space`**: O(1) — No extra space is used.
- **`Edge Cases Handled`**: Empty array, target value not present, all elements are the target value.
---
- ### 💭 **Reflection**
- Today's focus on in-place array manipulation using the two-pointer technique was incredibly insightful. Both problems reinforced the importance of maintaining a clean and efficient approach to modifying arrays without extra space.
- The key takeaway from "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array" was the realization that the sorted property of the array allows us to easily identify duplicates by comparing adjacent elements. This significantly simplifies the logic and ensures we only traverse the array once.
- In "Remove Element," the flexibility of the two-pointer technique was further highlighted. By adjusting the pointers based on whether the current element matches the target value, we can efficiently filter out unwanted elements while maintaining the order of the remaining elements.

- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - **`Time`**: O(n) — In the worst case, we may need to traverse the entire array.
  - **`Space`**: O(1) — No extra space is used, except for the output array in case of a carry-over.
- **`Edge Cases Handled`**: All digits are 9 (e.g., [9,9,9]), single digit arrays, no carry-over needed.
--- 
### 💭 **Reflection**
- Today's problem, "Plus One," was a fantastic exercise in handling carry-over logic in digit-based problems. The approach of traversing the array from the end allowed for a straightforward way to manage carry-overs, similar to how addition is performed manually.
- A key insight was recognizing that if all digits are 9, we need to create a new array to accommodate the extra digit resulting from the carry-over. This edge case was crucial to handle correctly to avoid index errors.

  - **`Space`**: O(1) — No extra space is used.
- **`Edge Cases Handled`**: No adjacent equal elements, all elements are the same.
---
### 💭 **Reflection**
- Today's problems, "Move Zeroes" and "Apply Operations to an Array," were excellent exercises in array manipulation and the two-pointer technique. Both problems required careful handling of element positions to achieve the desired outcomes efficiently.
- In "Move Zeroes," the challenge was to maintain the relative order of non-zero elements while shifting zeros to the end. The two-pointer approach proved to be an effective solution, allowing for a single pass through the array.
- "Apply Operations to an Array" introduced a different kind of manipulation, where adjacent equal elements needed to be processed. This problem reinforced the importance of careful iteration and condition checking to ensure the correct application of operations without disrupting the array's structure.
